# Question Answering
Explore transfer learning with state-of-the-art models like T5 and BERT, then build a model that can answer questions.

## Learning Objectives

* Gain intuition for how transfer learning works in the context of NLP
* Identify two approaches to transfer learning
* Discuss the evolution of language models from CBOW to T5 and Bert
* Fine-tune BERT on a dataset
* Implement context-based question answering with T5
* Interpret the GLUE benchmark
